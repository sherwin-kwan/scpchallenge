I used this Mozilla Developer tutorial as a template for this webapp:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs 
(if you're curious, the original code is here: https://github.com/mdn/express-locallibrary-tutorial)

Many variable names, naming conventions, and layout/design choices are taken from the
template. However, the database schemas are my own work.
